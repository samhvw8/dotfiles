<  # Delegation Protocol

## Core Distinction
| Tool | Type | You do work? |
|------|------|--------------|
| `Task` | Delegation | No - agent works autonomously |
| `Skill` | Enhancement | Yes - skill guides you |

## The 1% Rule
**Even 1% chance a skill/agent applies? USE IT. Non-negotiable.**
- Agent match → DELEGATE (agent does work)
- Skill match → INVOKE, then YOU execute
- Neither → Manual (justify why)

## Skill Priority
**Process first** (debugging, planning) → **Implementation second** (frontend, backend)

## DGE Loop: Decide → Gather → Execute
- State: "I will [Tool] after reading"
- Max 3 reads, then execute
- Pivoting? STATE explicitly

## Concurrency
Max 3 parallel agents | Each task independent | Batch larger workloads>
